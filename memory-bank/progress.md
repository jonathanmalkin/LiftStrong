# Progress Tracking for LiftStrong

## Project Status: Initial Implementation Phase

The LiftStrong project has moved from planning to initial implementation. The project requirements, architecture, and technical decisions are documented in the memory bank, and initial code implementation has begun.

## What Works

The following has been accomplished:

- ✅ Project requirements and features defined in projectbrief.md
- ✅ Product context and user experience goals documented in productContext.md
- ✅ System architecture and design patterns established in systemPatterns.md
- ✅ Technical stack and development setup defined in techContext.md
- ✅ Current work focus and next steps outlined in activeContext.md
- ✅ Memory bank initialized with core documentation files
- ✅ App launcher icons created and implemented
- ✅ VS Code configured for Android development with extensions and project settings

## What's Left to Build

The entire application needs to be built. Here's a high-level breakdown of the major components that need to be implemented:

### Core Infrastructure
- [x] Project setup in Android Studio
- [x] Gradle configuration with dependencies
- [x] Application class and dependency injection setup
- [x] Navigation component configuration
- [x] Theme and style resources
- [x] App launcher icons
- [x] VS Code setup for Android development

### Data Layer
- [ ] Room database implementation
- [ ] Entity classes for all data models
- [ ] Data Access Objects (DAOs)
- [ ] Repository implementations
- [ ] DataStore for user preferences

### UI Layer
- [ ] Main activity with navigation host
- [ ] Bottom navigation implementation
- [ ] Exercise module UI (list, details, search)
- [ ] Workout module UI (templates, active workout, history)
- [ ] Progress module UI (graphs, PRs, statistics)
- [ ] Settings module UI (user preferences)

### Features
- [ ] Exercise database functionality
- [ ] Workout logging and tracking
- [ ] Rest timer implementation
- [ ] Progress tracking and visualization
- [ ] Workout templates
- [ ] Personal records tracking
- [ ] User settings and preferences

## Known Issues

As no code has been written yet, there are no known issues in the implementation. However, some potential challenges have been identified:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring smooth performance during workout logging, especially with frequent database operations.

2. **UI Responsiveness**: Creating an intuitive and efficient UI for workout logging that minimizes user interaction during workouts.

3. **Data Visualization**: Implementing effective progress visualization that provides meaningful insights to users.

4. **Database Design**: Designing a flexible database schema that can accommodate future feature additions.

## Next Milestone: Project Setup and Basic Infrastructure

The next milestone is to set up the Android project and implement the basic infrastructure:

- [ ] Create Android project in Android Studio
- [ ] Configure Gradle with necessary dependencies
- [ ] Set up project structure following MVVM architecture
- [ ] Implement Room database with initial entities
- [ ] Create basic UI scaffolding with navigation

Target completion: TBD

## Overall Progress

```
[▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] ~15%
```

The project is approximately 15% complete, with the planning and documentation phase completed and initial implementation begun. The app launcher icons have been created and implemented, and the project infrastructure is set up. The next phase will involve implementing the core features.

This progress tracking document will be updated regularly as the project advances through different phases of development.
