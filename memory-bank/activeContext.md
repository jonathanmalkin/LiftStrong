# Active Context for LiftStrong

## Current Work Focus

The LiftStrong project is currently in the initial planning and setup phase. We are establishing the foundation for the Android workout tracking application by:

1. Creating the memory bank documentation to capture the project requirements, architecture, and technical decisions.
2. Planning the system architecture and component relationships.
3. Defining the database schema and data models.
4. Preparing for the initial project setup in Android Studio.

## Recent Changes

As this is the beginning of the project, there are no recent code changes to report. The memory bank is being initialized with the core documentation files:

- projectbrief.md: Comprehensive breakdown of the app design and features
- productContext.md: Why the project exists and problems it solves
- systemPatterns.md: System architecture and design patterns
- techContext.md: Technologies, development setup, and dependencies
- activeContext.md (this file): Current work focus and next steps
- progress.md: Tracking project progress

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the LiftStrong project are:

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Create a new Android project in Android Studio
   - Configure Gradle with necessary dependencies
   - Set up the project structure following the defined architecture

2. **Database Implementation**:
   - Define Room entities based on the database schema
   - Create DAOs (Data Access Objects) for database operations
   - Implement the database class and migrations

3. **Repository Layer**:
   - Implement repositories for each module (Exercise, Workout, User)
   - Create data sources for local storage

4. **UI Scaffolding**:
   - Set up the main activity with navigation
   - Create fragment stubs for main screens
   - Implement basic navigation between screens

5. **Core Feature Implementation**:
   - Start with the exercise database functionality
   - Implement workout logging basics
   - Create simple progress tracking

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Database Schema Refinement**:
   - Considering the best way to structure workout templates vs. actual workouts
   - Evaluating the most efficient way to store and retrieve exercise history
   - Determining the appropriate level of detail for exercise instructions

2. **UI/UX Decisions**:
   - Evaluating different approaches for the workout logging screen to maximize efficiency
   - Considering the best way to display progress graphs for different metrics
   - Determining the most intuitive navigation pattern for the app

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Planning for efficient database queries, especially for progress tracking
   - Considering strategies for handling large workout history datasets
   - Evaluating the use of pagination for loading workout history

4. **Feature Prioritization**:
   - Core workout tracking functionality is the highest priority
   - Progress visualization is second priority
   - Additional features like workout templates and exercise alternatives will come later

This active context will be updated regularly as the project progresses, with new focus areas, recent changes, and next steps being documented to maintain a clear picture of the current state of development.
