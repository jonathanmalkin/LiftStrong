# Active Context for LiftStrong

## Current Work Focus

The LiftStrong project has progressed from the initial planning phase to active implementation. We are now focused on:

1. Implementing the core functionality of the Android workout tracking application.
2. Building out the database layer with Room entities, DAOs, and repositories.
3. Developing the UI components for the main features (workouts, routines, progress, profile).
4. Setting up navigation and the overall application structure.

## Recent Changes

Recent changes to the project include:

1. **Project Structure Implementation**:
   - Set up the MVVM architecture with appropriate packages
   - Created the main activity with navigation components
   - Implemented fragments for the main screens (workout, routines, progress, profile)
   - Added ViewModels for each major feature

2. **Database Layer Implementation**:
   - Created Room database class (LiftStrongDatabase)
   - Implemented entity classes for all data models:
     - User
     - Exercise
     - Workout
     - WorkoutExercise
     - WorkoutSet
     - WorkoutTemplate
     - TemplateExercise
     - TemplateSet
   - Developed DAOs for database access:
     - UserDao
     - ExerciseDao
     - WorkoutDao
     - WorkoutTemplateDao

3. **Repository Layer Implementation**:
   - Created repository interfaces and implementations:
     - UserRepository
     - ExerciseRepository
     - WorkoutRepository
     - WorkoutTemplateRepository
   - Set up dependency injection with Hilt for repositories

4. **UI Development**:
   - Implemented layout files for main screens and list items
   - Created navigation graph (nav_graph.xml)
   - Added bottom navigation menu
   - Implemented basic UI for workout tracking, routines, progress, and profile screens

5. **Resource Files**:
   - Added app launcher icons and navigation icons
   - Created color and theme resources
   - Added string resources

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the LiftStrong project are:

1. **Complete Workout Tracking Functionality**:
   - Implement the active workout logging interface
   - Add functionality to create and log workout sets
   - Implement the rest timer feature
   - Connect workout UI to the repository layer

2. **Routine Management**:
   - Complete the routine creation and editing functionality
   - Implement starting a workout from a routine template
   - Add routine filtering and organization

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Implement progress graphs using MPAndroidChart
   - Add personal record tracking and visualization
   - Create exercise history views

4. **User Profile and Settings**:
   - Complete user profile management
   - Implement settings for units, rest timer defaults, etc.
   - Add data backup and restore functionality

5. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Write unit tests for repositories and ViewModels
   - Perform UI testing for critical user flows
   - Optimize database queries for performance

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Workout Logging UX**:
   - Evaluating the most efficient way to log sets during an active workout
   - Considering different approaches for the rest timer UI and notifications
   - Determining the best way to display previous workout data during logging

2. **Data Visualization Strategy**:
   - Deciding on the most meaningful metrics to display in progress graphs
   - Evaluating different chart types for various progress metrics
   - Considering time-based filtering options for progress data

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implementing efficient database queries for workout history
   - Using pagination for loading large datasets
   - Optimizing UI rendering for smooth scrolling in lists

4. **Feature Prioritization**:
   - Focusing on completing the core workout tracking functionality first
   - Prioritizing a smooth, efficient workout logging experience
   - Planning for incremental addition of more advanced features

This active context will be updated regularly as the project progresses, with new focus areas, recent changes, and next steps being documented to maintain a clear picture of the current state of development.
