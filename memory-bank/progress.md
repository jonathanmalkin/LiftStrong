# Progress Tracking for LiftStrong

## Project Status: Active Implementation Phase

The LiftStrong project has progressed from planning to active implementation. The core architecture is in place, and significant progress has been made on implementing the database layer, repository layer, and UI components.

## What Works

The following has been accomplished:

- ✅ Project requirements and features defined in projectbrief.md
- ✅ Product context and user experience goals documented in productContext.md
- ✅ System architecture and design patterns established in systemPatterns.md
- ✅ Technical stack and development setup defined in techContext.md
- ✅ Current work focus and next steps outlined in activeContext.md
- ✅ Memory bank initialized with core documentation files
- ✅ Project setup in Android Studio
- ✅ Gradle configuration with dependencies
- ✅ Application class and dependency injection setup
- ✅ Navigation component configuration
- ✅ Theme and style resources
- ✅ App launcher icons
- ✅ VS Code setup for Android development
- ✅ Room database structure with entity classes
- ✅ Data Access Objects (DAOs) for database operations
- ✅ Repository interfaces and implementations
- ✅ Main activity with navigation host
- ✅ Bottom navigation implementation
- ✅ Basic UI structure for main screens (fragments and layouts)

## What's Left to Build

While significant progress has been made, several key components still need to be implemented:

### Data Layer
- [ ] Complete data model relationships and queries
- [ ] Implement data converters for complex types
- [ ] Add database migrations strategy
- [ ] Implement DataStore for user preferences

### UI Layer
- [ ] Complete exercise module UI (list, details, search)
- [ ] Finish workout module UI (active workout logging, history)
- [ ] Implement progress module UI (graphs, PRs, statistics)
- [ ] Complete settings module UI (user preferences)
- [ ] Add data binding for all UI components
- [ ] Implement RecyclerView adapters for all list views

### Features
- [ ] Exercise database functionality with search and filtering
- [ ] Active workout logging and tracking
- [ ] Rest timer implementation
- [ ] Progress tracking and visualization with charts
- [ ] Workout templates creation and management
- [ ] Personal records tracking and notifications
- [ ] User settings and preferences management
- [ ] Data backup and restore functionality

## Known Issues

As the project is still in the implementation phase, some challenges have been identified:

1. **Database Query Optimization**: Need to optimize complex queries for workout history and progress tracking to ensure good performance.

2. **UI Responsiveness**: The workout logging interface needs to be optimized for quick interactions during active workouts.

3. **Navigation Flow**: Some navigation paths between fragments need refinement for a smoother user experience.

4. **Data Visualization**: Implementation of progress charts will require careful design to provide meaningful insights.

## Next Milestone: Core Workout Functionality

The next milestone is to complete the core workout tracking functionality:

- [ ] Implement active workout logging interface
- [ ] Add functionality to create and log workout sets
- [ ] Implement rest timer feature
- [ ] Connect workout UI to the repository layer
- [ ] Add workout history view

Target completion: TBD

## Overall Progress

```
[▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] ~40%
```

The project is approximately 40% complete. The planning and documentation phase is complete, and significant progress has been made on the implementation of the core architecture, database layer, and basic UI components. The next phase will focus on implementing the core features and refining the user interface.

This progress tracking document will be updated regularly as the project advances through different phases of development.
